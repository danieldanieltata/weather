# Weather


This is a web apllication that can show you the weather, in the picture below you can see my first basic design of the 

![Task Image](https://i.ibb.co/7rpxRzD/Screen-Shot-2019-06-18-at-12-28-20.png "Task Image" )
# Some things to say
- Client - I'm assuming that the port is 4200
- Server - I'm assuming that the port is 3000
- MongoDB - I'm assuming that the port is 27017

# Things I want to change in the code 
- I didn't make a good config file, I need to do one 
 - Client - The app component should be more clean, I will make other components that will be the container of the small components
 - Client - Somehow ignore the scrolling(change the ui a little bit)
 - Server - The backend is not perfect, need to rearrange some things and make it look better
 - Server - Make the server more robust 


# Edge cases
 - For the sake of the task I passed every http request to my server, even if its for other api(**as required, to use a backend node js**)
 - You cant search by country, the weather api dosen't provide that for what I know
 - No Small screens compabilty,  for now 
 - No password enctyption yet 

# Features that good to know about
- If you have a user the server saves your last searched places, also you can make a selected places
- If you search city you get the weather of all week 

# Some more features that I want to do in the future

  - The user can press he's last searched destinations or most searched destinations and get a weekly weather 
  - The user can add multiple destinations and compare the weather between them
